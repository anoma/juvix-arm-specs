# The ARM v2 Interface in Juvix

This repo contains the specification of the general Anoma resource machine (ARM) interface in Juvix according to [specs v2](https://specs.anoma.net/v2/system_architecture/state/resource_machine/index.html).
ARM instantiations (e.g., the transparent or shielded resource machines) must adhere to this interface and implement all Juvix `axiom` statements.
